## Game Guide to Assist in Grading
1. Use '/home' command from various rooms (7 total options) to increase puzzle value to be rewarded a key (5 times, can all be done from lab (n of base) if you want to get it done fast)
2. Once awarded Key, Unlock door in the main room (check your puzzle value, then get rewarded a key, go to home and unlock the locked door)
3. Grab book from locked room (use grab command in locked room)
4. Make way to stables and use the computer, then victory. (use south command twice from base, then do /use and if you got the book you win. You can read the books as well!)
Hint: Be careful about objects you pick up and consume. (various objects have different properties, too heavy (table) causes no movement, consumables can be positive or negative)
